# Hexagonal Architecture

# What is Hexagonal Architecture?

Hexagonal Architecture, also referred to as Ports and Adapters Architecture or Ports and Adapters Pattern, is an approach to software development that isolates the central business logic of an application from its external interfaces and infrastructure components. The main objective of Hexagonal Architecture is to design a system that is not reliant on any particular technology, framework, or infrastructure, which facilitates the modification or replacement of these components without impacting the core business logic. This architecture focuses on creating a versatile and scalable system that can develop over time.

# Why Hexagonal Architecture?

Hexagonal Architecture is a great choice for applications that are expected to evolve over time. It is also a good choice for applications that are expected to have multiple interfaces or infrastructure components. This architecture is also a good choice for applications that are expected to have multiple interfaces or infrastructure components.

# Components of Hexagonal Architecture

Hexagonal Architecture is composed of three main components: the core, the adapters, and the infrastructure. The core is the central business logic of the application. It is the part of the application that is responsible for the application's behavior. The adapters are the components that are responsible for interfacing with the external world. The infrastructure is the part of the application that is responsible for the application's behavior. The adapters are the components that are responsible for interfacing with the external world.
